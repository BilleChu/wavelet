# Buffett Investment Analysis Reference Guide

## Investment Philosophy

Warren Buffett's investment approach is built on several core principles:

### 1. Circle of Competence
- Only invest in businesses you understand
- Stay within your knowledge boundaries
- Avoid complex or opaque business models

### 2. Economic Moat
A durable competitive advantage that protects a company from competition:

- **Brand Power**: Strong consumer recognition and loyalty
- **Network Effects**: Value increases with more users
- **Switching Costs**: High cost for customers to switch
- **Cost Advantages**: Lower costs than competitors
- **Intangible Assets**: Patents, licenses, regulatory barriers

### 3. Management Quality

Key attributes to evaluate:
- **Capital Allocation**: How management deploys company resources
- **Shareholder Orientation**: Alignment with shareholder interests
- **Integrity**: Honesty and transparency in communications
- **Track Record**: Historical performance and consistency

### 4. Financial Strength

Important metrics:
- **Return on Equity (ROE)**: Target > 15%
- **Return on Invested Capital (ROIC)**: Target > 12%
- **Debt-to-Equity**: Prefer < 0.5
- **Interest Coverage**: Prefer > 5x
- **Free Cash Flow**: Consistent and growing

### 5. Margin of Safety

- Buy at significant discount to intrinsic value
- Target margin of safety: 25% or more
- Provides protection against estimation errors

## Valuation Methods

### Discounted Cash Flow (DCF)

```
Intrinsic Value = Σ(FCF / (1+r)^t) + Terminal Value / (1+r)^n

Where:
- FCF = Free Cash Flow
- r = Discount rate (WACC)
- t = Time period
- n = Number of projection years
```

### Dividend Discount Model (DDM)

```
Intrinsic Value = D1 / (r - g)

Where:
- D1 = Next year's dividend
- r = Required return
- g = Dividend growth rate
```

### Earnings Power Value (EPV)

```
EPV = Normalized Earnings / Cost of Capital

Where:
- Normalized Earnings = Average adjusted earnings
- Cost of Capital = Required return
```
